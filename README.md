Used React ts for frontend and Express ts with Db Postgres sql for backend. The data that are displayed are dynamically from the backend server. The user can easily book flight tickets , receive the tickets in mail.

## How to run:

Click the live url or clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/adarsh1445/Tech-Innovation-Task/ and open ui then run npm install then run npm start which will open a localhost where the project gets displayed.

## Note:
 Used Razorpay Test payments for demo transactions since no real payment happens. So make Complete transaction and recieve the ticket.
